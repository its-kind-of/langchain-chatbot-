# Language Chain

This code demonstrates the usage of Language Chain, a library for question answering and text retrieval. It utilizes various components such as document loaders, text splitters, embeddings, vector stores, and retrieval question answering chains.

## Installation

To run this code, make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using the following command:

```pip install langchain faiss```
Additionally, you need to set up an OpenAI API key by following the 
instructions provided by OpenAI. Once you have the API key, replace the empty 
```os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = " "``` in the code with your actual API key.

# Usage
1. Specify the URLs of the documents you want to process by adding them to the urls list in the code.

2. Run the code, and it will load the documents from the specified URLs using the UnstructuredURLLoader and split the text into chunks using the CharacterTextSplitter.

3. The code then uses the OpenAI language model to generate embeddings for the text chunks and creates a vector store using FAISS.

4. The vector store is saved to a file named faiss_store_openai.pkl using pickle.

5. To use the retrieval question answering chain, run the code and provide a question as input when prompted. The code will retrieve relevant information based on the question using the previously created vector store and the OpenAI language model.

6. Please note that the actual functionality and performance of the code may depend on the specific documents and queries used.
